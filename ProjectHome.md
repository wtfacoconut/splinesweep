Quick and dirty Qt based linux program that uses a sequence of full colour and laser line/spline images captured using a simple 3D scanner to create a textured 3D obj format model.
The project depends on both Qt and OpenCV and is very much pre-alpha.
Details on building the hardware side of the project is available here: http://matthewshotton.wordpress.com
and a slightly more in-depth overview of the software is available here:
